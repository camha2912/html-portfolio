<h3>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)</h3>
<p>We watched this movie together at my house. Both of us were impresses with Asian actors in this movie.</p>

<h3>Eternals (2021)</h3>
<p>We watched this movie at my boyfriend's house. It was pretty annoying as we could not find a proper website to watch
    this movie.</p>

<h3>Spider-Man: No Way Home</h3>
<p>We wanted to watch this movie as soon as it was released so when both could not go to the cinema, we found a website
    and watched on our own while calling each other via Zoom lol.</p>

<h3>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)</h3>
<p>We went to the cinema to watch this movie together.</p>

<h3>Thor: Love and Thunder (2022)</h3>
<p>The ticket said that we watched this movie in the morning at CGV Indochina tho I couldn't remember why we went for a
    movie at that time.</p>

<h3>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)</h3>
<p>I'm pretty sure that was the first time ever in history we went to NCC to watch a movie together.</p>

<h3>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023)</h3>
<p>My boyfriend decided that we would watch this movie 1 day prior to the official release day so we went to the cinema
    at midnight after work to enjoy the movie together without getting spoiled.</p>
